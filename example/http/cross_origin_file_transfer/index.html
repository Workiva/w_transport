        <p>
            Drag and drop files to upload them to a server via HTTP. Once files have been uploaded, they can be downloaded to the client.
            This example uses the client-side implementation of <code>WRequest</code> and <code>WResponse</code> to transfer files to and from the server.
            If you choose to enable the proxy server, all requests will go through the proxy instead of directly to the file server.
            This effectively tests the server-side implementation of <code>WRequest</code> and <code>WStreamedResponse</code> since the
            proxy server uses it to communicate with the file server.
