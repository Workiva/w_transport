## Upgrade Guide: v2.x to v3.0.0

The 3.0.0 release of w_transport is intended to be completely
backwards-compatible with version 2. If you are already on version >=2.0.0, you
should be able to update the version range to include the 3.x line without
having to make any code changes:

```yaml
dependencies:
  w_transport: ">=2.0.0 <4.0.0"
```

If you have any issues or find any breaking changes while upgrading from v2.x
to v3.0.0, **this is a bug and should be fixed - please
[file an issue](https://github.com/Workiva/w_transport/issues/new).**


### Dart SDK

The minimum Dart SDK version has been raised to `1.14.0`.


### Deprecations

#### Library Entry Points

The entry point filenames (excluding the main `w_transport.dart`) have been
shortened. The old entry points have been deprecated and will be removed in
version 4. Until then, they will continue to function as expected.

- `w_transport_browser.dart` --> `browser.dart`

  ```diff
  - import 'package:w_transport/w_transport_browser.dart';
  + import 'package:w_transport/browser.dart';
  ```

- `w_transport_mock.dart` --> `mock.dart`

  ```diff
  - import 'package:w_transport/w_transport_mock.dart';
  + import 'package:w_transport/mock.dart';
  ```
  
- `w_transport_vm.dart` --> `vm.dart`
  
  ```diff
  - import 'package:w_transport/w_transport_vm.dart';
  + import 'package:w_transport/vm.dart';
  ```

#### Renames

The following public API members have been renamed. In order to maintain
backwards compatibility, the old versions will remain (in a deprecated state)
and will continue to function as expected until version 4.

- `Client` --> `HttpClient`

  _(entry point: `w_transport/w_transport.dart`)_
  
  ```diff
  - new Client();
  + new HttpClient();
  ```

- `WSocket` --> `WebSocket`
  
  _(entry point: `w_transport/w_transport.dart`)_

  ```diff
  - WSocket.connect(...);
  + WebSocket.connect(...);
  ```
  
- `WSocketException` --> `WebSocketException`
  
  _(entry point: `w_transport/w_transport.dart`)_

  ```diff
  try {
    await WebSocket.connect(...);
  - } on WSocketException {
  + } on WebSocketException {
    // Handle connection failure.
  }
  ```

- `RetryBackOff.duration` --> `RetryBackOff.interval`
  
  _(entry point: `w_transport/w_transport.dart`)_

  > This will not affect most consumers as the properties on `RetryBackOff` are
  > most likely only read by internal `w_transport` code.

  ```diff
  final backOff = const RetryBackOff.fixed(const Duration(seconds: 5));
  - print(backOff.duration);
  + print(backOff.interval);
  ```

#### Future Removals

The following public API members have been deprecated in anticipation of them
being removed in version 4.

- `WSocketCloseEvent`
  
  _(entry point: `w_transport/w_transport.dart`)_

  This was previously only used internally, but was erroneously exported as a
  part of the public API. It is no longer used at all, and has thus been
  deprecated and will be removed in version 4.

- Unnecessary mock classes:

  - `MockBaseRequest`
  - `MockClient`
  - `MockFormRequest`
  - `MockJsonRequest`
  - `MockPlainTextRequest`
  - `MockResponse`
  - `MockStreamedRequest`
  - `MockStreamedResponse`
  - `MockWSocket`
  
  _(entry point: `w_transport/mock.dart`)_
  
  All of these classes were exposed prior to the full transport mocks API being
  available. They provided a way to control mock instances of requests and
  WebSockets, but it required having access to the instances (which isn't always
  possible) and required type checks/casts. They will be removed in version 4.
