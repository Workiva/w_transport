**Transport library for sending HTTP requests and opening WebSockets.**

HTTP support includes plain-text, JSON, form-data, and multipart data, as well
as custom encoding. Also supports automatic retrying and request & response
interception.

WebSocket support includes native WebSockets in the browser and the VM with
the option to use SockJS in the browser.

All transport classes are platform-independent and can be configured to work
in the browser or on the Dart VM. Additionally, all transport classes can be
mocked out and controlled through an API included with this library.

- [Changelog](/CHANGELOG.md)


#### Older Versions

- 1.0.x - [docs](https://github.com/Workiva/w_transport/blob/1.0.0/README.md) / [code](https://github.com/Workiva/w_transport/tree/1.0.0)
- 2.x - [docs](https://github.com/Workiva/w_transport/blob/2.0.0/README.md) / [code](https://github.com/Workiva/w_transport/tree/2.0.0) / [upgrade guide (v2 -> v3)](https://github.com/Workiva/w_transport/blob/master/docs/upgrade-guides/v3.0.0.md)


### Installing
As of version 3.0.0, w_transport will be following a
[versioning and stability](#versioning-and-stability) commitment that guarantees
a compatibility lifespan of two major versions.

If you're installing w_transport for the first time, simply depend on the latest
major version and you'll get all patches and minor versions as they are
released:

```yaml
dependencies:
  w_transport: ^3.0.0
```

If you're upgrading from version 2.x, you should be able to use the above
version range without breaking any existing code. **Check out the [3.0.0
upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade-guides/v3.0.0.md)**.


### Importing

The main entry point contains all of the transport classes necessary for sending
HTTP requests and establishing WebSocket connections. It is also
platform-independent (depends on neither `dart:html` nor `dart:io`), which means
you can use it to build components, libraries, or APIs that will be reusable in
the browser **and** on the Dart VM.

```dart
import 'package:w_transport/w_transport.dart' as transport;
```

> We strongly recommend importing with the prefix `transport` because there are
> some classes whose names conflict with classes from the Dart SDK.

The end consumer will make the decision between browser and VM, most likely in a
`main()` block.


### Dart SDK

As of version 3.0.0 of the `w_transport` package, the minimum required Dart SDK
version is 1.14.0 (released Jan 28, 2016).


### Versioning and Stability

This library follows semver to the best of our interpretation of it. We want
this library to be a stable dependency thatâ€™s easy to keep current. A good
explanation of the versioning scheme that we intend to follow can be seen here
from React.js:

https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/02/19/new-versioning-scheme.html

In short: our goal is for every major release to be backwards compatible with
the previous major version, giving consumers a lifespan of two major versions to
deal with deprecations.


### Credits

This library was influenced in many ways by
[the `http` package](https://github.com/dart-lang/http), especially with regard
to multipart requests, and served as a useful source for references to pertinent
IETF RFCs.


### Development

This project leverages [the `dart_dev` package](https://github.com/Workiva/dart_dev)
for most of its tooling needs, including static analysis, code
formatting, running tests, collecting coverage, and serving examples.
Check out the dart_dev readme for more information.

> **To run integration tests, you'll need two JS dependencies for a SockJS
> server. Run `npm install` to download them.**
