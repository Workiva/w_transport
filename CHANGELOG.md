# Changelog

## [2.4.0](https://github.com/Workiva/w_transport/compare/2.3.2...2.4.0)
_May 4, 2016_

- **Improvement:** `FormRequest` now supports fields with multiple values.

    ```dart
    var request = new FormRequest()
      ..fields['multi'] = ['one', 'two'];
    ```

- **SDK Compatibility:** Dart 1.16 exposed a new `Client` class from the
  `dart:html` library that conflicted with the `Client` class in this library.
  This has been fixed by adjusting our imports internally, but it may still
  affect consumers of this library.

- **Documentation:** fixed inaccurate documentation around mocking & testing
  with WebSockets.

## [2.3.2](https://github.com/Workiva/w_transport/compare/2.3.0...2.3.2)
_March 2, 2016_

- **Bug Fix:** requests created from a `Client` now properly inherit all of the
  `autoRetry` configuration. Previously the `backOff`, `forTimeouts`, and
  `maxRetries` settings were missing.

## [2.3.0](https://github.com/Workiva/w_transport/compare/2.2.0...2.3.0)
_February 11, 2016_

### Features

- Implemented retry back-off to allow fixed or exponential back-off between
  request retries. By default, there is no back-off.

    ```dart
    // Fixed back-off: 1 second between attempts.
    var request = new Request();
    request.autoRetry
      ..enabled = true
      ..backOff = new RetryBackOff.fixed(new Duration(seconds: 1));

    // Exponential back-off: 250ms, 500ms, 1s, 2s, etc (base*2^attempt)
    var request = new Request();
    request.autoRetry
      ..enabled = true
      ..backOff = new RetryBackOff.exponential(new Duration(milliseconds: 125));
  ```

- Added methods to all request classes for manually retrying failures. This is
  mainly useful for corner cases where the request's success is dependent on
  something else and where automatic retrying won't help.

    ```dart
    var request = new Request();
    // send request, catch failure

    var response = await request.retry(); // normal
    var response = await request.streamRetry(); // streamed
    ```

- Improved error messaging around failed requests. If automatic retrying is
  enabled, the error message for a failed request will include each individual
  attempt and why it failed.

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/Workiva/w_transport/compare/2.1.0...2.2.0)
_February 8, 2016_

### Features

- Added an `autoRetry.forTimeouts` flag (defaults to `true`) to the `Client`
  class and all request classes. This flag determines whether or not requests
  that are canceled due to exceeding the timeout threshold should be retried.

    ```dart
    // This request will retry if the timeout is exceeded.
    var request = new Request()
      ..timeoutThreshold = new Duration(seconds: 10)
      ..autoRetry.enabled = true;

    // This request will NOT retry if the timeout is exceeded.
    var request = new Request()
      ..timeoutThreshold = new Duration(seconds: 10)
      ..autoRetry.enabled = true
      ..autoRetry.forTimeouts = false;
  ```

- Added a `Duration sockJSTimeout` config option to `WSocket.connect()`.

    ```dart
    // browser only
    var socket = await WSocket.connect(Uri.parse('...'),
        useSockJS: true, sockJSTimeout: new Duration(seconds: 5));
    ```

## [2.1.0](https://github.com/Workiva/w_transport/compare/2.0.0...2.1.0)
_January 7, 2016_

### Deprecation: SockJS global configuration

As of v2.0.0, this library could be configured to use SockJS under the hood when
the `WSocket` class was used to establish WebSocket connections. This
configuration occurred on a global basis (meaning it affected every `WSocket`
instance) which is undesirable for applications with a mixed usage of native
WebSockets and SockJS. **This global configuration has been deprecated.**

As of v2.1.0, passing `useSockJS: true` to the `configureWTransportForBrowser()`
method will cause a deprecation warning to be printed to the console.

The SockJS configuration should now occur on a per-socket basis via the
`WSocket.connect()` method:

```dart
Uri uri = Uri.parse('ws://echo.websocket.org');
WSocket webSocket = await WSocket.connect(uri,
   useSockJS: true, sockJSProtocolsWhitelist: ['websocket', 'xhr-streaming']);
```

### Features

- Added a `baseUri` field to `Client` that all requests from the client will
  inherit.

- All request classes now support a timeout threshold via the `timeoutTreshold`
  field. This was also added to the `Client` class and all requests created from
  a client will inherit this value.

- Request and response interception is now supported. This can be done directly
  on a request instance, but more usefully through a `Client` instance. See
  ["request & response interception"](README.md#request--response-interception)
  and ["intercepting requests & responses from a client"](README.md#intercepting-requests--responses-from-a-client)
  in the README.

- All request classes and the `Client` class now include an API for automatic
  retrying via the `autoRetry` field. See ["automatic request retrying"](README.md#automatic-request-retrying)
  in the README.

- Added a `replace` method to `Response` and `StreamedResponse` to allow simple
  creation of new responses based on another response, while changing only the
  fields you specify. This is particularly useful during response interception.

### Bug Fixes

- Headers passed into a request's dispatch method (ex: `.get(headers: {...})`)
  are now merged with any existing headers on the request (previously they were
  being ignored).


## [2.0.0](https://github.com/Workiva/w_transport/compare/1.0.1...2.0.0)
_November 24, 2015_

> The 2.0.0 release is a major breaking release. While many of the patterns from
> 1.0.x were maintained, the HTTP API was broken up into several request classes
> and two response classes for a much more robust and useful API. As such, there
> is no backwards compatibility, but a migration guide is included below.

### Features

- **WebSockets**
  - Single API for the browser and the Dart VM.
  - Option to use SockJS library in place of native WebSockets for the ability
    to fall back to XHR streaming (configuration only, no API usage difference).

- **HTTP**
  - Support for most commonly used request types:
    - `Request` (content-type: text/plain)
    - `JsonRequest` (content-type: application/json)
    - `FormRequest` (content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded)
    - `MultipartRequest` (content-type: multipart/form-data)
  - Synchronous access to response bodies as bytes, text, and JSON.
  - Asynchronous request bodies (`StreamedRequest`).
  - Asynchronous response bodies via `streamGet()`, `streamPost()`, etc. on any
    of the above request classes.
  - Automatic request encoding and response decoding.

- **Mocks**
  - Because this library is designed to be platform-agnostic, it's easy to
    introduce mocks simply by treating tests as another platform, just like the
    browser or the Dart VM.
  - Import `package:w_transport/w_transport_mock.dart` and call
    `configureWTransportForTest()` to configure w_transport to use mock
    implementations for every class.
  - No changes necessary to your source code!
  - Utilize the `MockTransports` class to control WebSocket connections and HTTP
    requests.

- **Testing**
  - A big initiative in this 2.0.0 release was to increase our test coverage -
    which we've done. **With almost 1000 statements, `w_transport` has 99.7%
    coverage!**
  - Since this library is concerned with transport protocols, it is imperative
    that our testing included rigorous integration tests. **We have over 1000
    integration tests that run in the browser and on the Dart VM against real
    servers.**
  - Our test suites run against our mock implementations as well to ensure they
    are in parity with the real implementations.

### Migration Guide

#### `WRequest`

The `WRequest` class attempted to cover all HTTP request use cases. Its closest
analog now is `Request` - the class for sending plain-text requests. All other
request classes share a similar base API with additional support for a specific
type of request data (JSON, form, multipart, or streamed).

#### `WResponse`

The `WResponse` class made request meta data (status, headers) available as soon
as the request had finished; however, in an attempt to unify the API between the
`dart:io` HTTP requests and `dart:html` XHR requests, the response body was only
available asynchronously (as a stream, an untyped future, or decoded to text).
This meant two asynchronous steps were required for every request - one to get
the response, and one to get the response body.

This has been greatly improved by switching to two different response classes:

- `Response` - response meta data and body available synchronously
- `StreamedResponse` - response meta data available synchronously, body
  available as a stream of bytes


## [1.0.1](https://github.com/Workiva/w_transport/compare/1.0.0...1.0.1)
_June 23, 2015_

**Bug Fixes:**

- Allow request data to be set to `null`.
- Canceling an in-flight request now properly results in the returned Future
  completing with an error.
- Request data type validation now happens when sending the request instead of
  upon assignment, allowing intermediate data assignments.
- Verify w_transport configuration has been set before constructing a `WHttp`
  instance.


## [1.0.0](https://github.com/Workiva/w_transport/compare/f9a8277b552902db962b8eb3d41c82ded4900284...1.0.0)
_May 21, 2015_

- Initial version of w_transport: a fluent-style, platform-agnostic library with
  ready to use transport classes for sending and receiving data over HTTP.
